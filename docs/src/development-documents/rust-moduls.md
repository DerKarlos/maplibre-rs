# Rust soure-code moduls

This is an overview an the structure of the funckton-packages and the Rust source-codes.
The "formal" API for the Rust crates are in the Docs, generated by komments in the source-codes.

Maplibre RS consists of
* the core map renderer,
* the user-UI and user-inout-controls 
* the demo applicatons for the different targets

## Mab renderer

TODO


### User UI and input control

maplibre-winit/..
* lib.rs:  mablibre-winit lib, including functions winit and inputs

maplibre-wini/winit/...  Window handler
* mod.rs: receiving window events and call of the input handler (maplibre-wini/input/mod.rs) and the map renderer
* noweb.rs: Event loop for desktop targets
* web.rs: Event loop for Web-Application
(Mobile devices ??)

maplibre-wini/input/...  Input handler  User UI for kamera view
* mod.rs: root of the input control, calls the following handlers:
* shift_handler.rs: Keyboard panning
* pan_handler.rs: Touch panning
* pinch_handler.rs: Touch zooming (still empty)
* query_handler.rs: Touch and Mouse klicking = down & up without move
* tilt_handler.rs: Keyboard camera rotating, only pitching = view up/down
* zoom_handler.rs: Keyboard and Mouse-scroll zooming


### Demo applicatons

Building the different targets is desctiptet in:
[How to Run Demos](./development-guide/how-to-run.md) and 
[Library Packaging](./development-documents/library-packaging.md)

#### Desktop application

maplibre-demo/.. 
* main.rs: The main shell applicatoin is taking [parameters](todo) and will opening a window. Or it will call the headless modul to write a bitmap.
* headless.rs: Renders the map into a offline canvas and writes a bitmap file


#### Web application (web/..)
The Rust crate(s) are build as WASM modul with JS clue-code and a HTML (Interface ???)
demo/..  ??
lib/..   ??

#### Apple (mobild AND desktop???)

#### Android app (android/..)

? The Rust crate(s?) are build as WASM modul and used by an android cradle(java wrapper?) ?
